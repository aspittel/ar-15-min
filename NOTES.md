# AR JS

## What is AR?

* We have some sort of interaction between the real world and the computer.
* You may have had virtual reality -- starts at or close to zero and creates a whole new world.

## Why me?
 * Saw an article on re-creating Snapchat filters in Python -- I thought it would be even cooler to make something web ready. I looked up a bunch of stuff and then wrote an article on it.
